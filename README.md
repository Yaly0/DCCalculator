# DCCalculator

DCCalculator is a C++ application that analyses and solves a DC circuit imported from [Falstad simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html) 
or entered by the user, using [Nodal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_analysis) in matrix format.

Elements that can be entered and used in the circuit:

- Resistors
- Voltage sources
- Current sources
- Ammeters
- Voltmeters
- Wattmeters

The solution consists of (as displayed below):

- Currents through all circuit branches
- Meters' readings
